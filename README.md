# Healthcare_Fraud_Detection
This project will include a machine learning fraud detection model for medical claims using the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data (MPPD), specifically the "Physician and Other Supplier" data (MPOP PS and MPOP P). This data, available from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), provides detailed information on provider utilization, payments, and charges, and can be linked with information from the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) to identify fraudulent providers.


Research question: Can machine learning models (specifically an unsupervised One-Class SVM) detect anomalous Medicare provider behavior indicative of fraud using utilization and payment data?
Objective: Identify unusual provider behavior patterns without relying on extensive labeled data.
